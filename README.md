# My new project

## Introduction

>What is iStudy?

>>The Company EyeGaze has built a new software built in iOS, called iStudy, an application designed for learning in special education by giving both teachers and students the ability to go through a daily online course regimen without ever touching the screen!

>How has EyeGaze done this?

>>The software allows users to easily navigate their iphones with a stable pointer on the screen by calibrating the location of the user's eyes. Plus, it is easily accessible for anyone with motor disabilities, since the movement of the head is not necessary to navigate as it was initially designed for. 

>Why Choose iStudy?

>>While other competitors in the market might seem to be flawless in both user interface and unremarkable programming components, it is not. EyeGaze has created iStudy to beat the best in the industry by targeting a much broader audience to which other competitors have failed to, such as Hawkeye. 
Eyegaze has created a newly improved app used for students in Special Education that will enable eye tracking to navigate through a classroom online setting allowing every student to be fully immersed and included. Istudy supports educational games that teachers can use as assignments for their students to learn from.
